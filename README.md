# SBA-318 | Express Server Application

## Objectives
- Create a server application with Node and Express.
- Create a RESTful API using Express.
- Create Express middleware.
- Use Express middleware.
- Use a template engine to render views with Express.
- Interact with a self-made API through HTML forms.

| Requirement | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware | 5% |
Create and use error-handling middleware | 5% |
| Use at least three different data categories (e.g., users, posts, or comments). | 5% |
Utilize reasonable data structuring practices. | 5% |
| Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client. | 5% |
| Create POST routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client creation via a POST request. | 5% |
| Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request. | 5% |
| Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request. | 5% |
| Include query parameters for data filtering, where appropriate. At least one data category should allow for additional filtering through the use of query parameters.<br>Note: DO NOT use API keys; this makes it more difficult for instructors to grade finished projects efficiently. | 5% |
| Utilize route parameters, where appropriate. | 5% |
Adhere to the guiding principles of REST. | 10% |
| Create and render at least one view using a view template and template engine. This can be a custom template engine or a third-party engine. If you are stuck on how to approach this, think about ways you could render the current state of your API's data for easy viewing. | 8% |
| Use simple CSS to style the rendered views. <br>Note: This is not a test of design; it is a test of serving static files using Express. The CSS can be very simple. | 2% |
| Include a form within a rendered view that allows for interaction with your RESTful API. | 3% |
| Utilize reasonable code organization practices. | 5% |
| Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit). | 10% |
| Commit frequently to the git repository. | 5% |
| Include a README file that contains a description of your application. | 2% |
| Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience. | 5% |

## Bonus Objectives
| Bonus | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Include a practical usage of regular expressions within route paths.<br>Note: A forced, arbitrary usage of this technique will not earn you any bonus credit. This must be practical and sensible in order to be considered for credit. | +1% |
| Research and effectively use at least one third-party Node package for practical, sensible purposes.<br>This cannot be a package that has been used in examples and lesson materials thus far. Step outside the box and be creative! | +1% |
